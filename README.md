    - A chrome extension that keeps your favorite radio garden stations safe.

## Problem
Radio Garden is a great website to discover all the amazing  radio stations around the world, however, at the time I started this project there wasn't a way to save the stations that I liked permanently. Everytime the cookie was cleaned, all of my favorite stations would be lost and I wasn't able to find them again. Sigh~

## Solution
Make a browser that silently syncs the Favorites list on Radio Garden.

### Funtionalities includes:
- Save the current favorite list on install.
- Save the updated list everytime user updates their Favorites station list on Radio Garden.
- Sync it to their cloud.

## Techs Used
 - Javascript
 - Chrome API
